# MeterInventory

A project that I completed in 2015 and 2016 at the Reed Research Reactor. This Excel workbook includes a macro that assembles an inventory from a folder of meter calibration forms. This is done in three steps. First, it iterates through every spreadsheet in the folder and pulls the desired fields from them. They are then sorted, and outdated spreadsheets (ones with the same serial number but an older date than another) are moved to a seperate folder to improve speed in the future. Finally, the most recent information is displayed in the front worksheet. 

This project, along with tweaks to the meter calibration procedures virtually eliminated errors in the meter inventory, which had previously been a consistent problem.
